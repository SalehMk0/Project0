# Project0
This is the first project for CS50 Harvard web programming
1-First page (index.html) contains the main and normal search that we redirect the user to google search.
2-Second page (image.html) contains the image search that opens directly the images section of the regular google search.
3-Third page (advanced.html) contains the advanced search that excludes certain words and look up for others, just like the advanced google search.

The styling was inspired also by google color palette design.
